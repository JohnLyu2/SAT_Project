# ECE650 : Programming Assignment 1

Replace FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, WATIAM, and STUDENT_ID, EMAIL in
`user.yml` by your first and last name, WatIAM id, student number, and
email, respectively. Whenever possible, please use ASCII characters.

Do not change the format `user.yml`. We will parse it
automatically. Only enter the information requested.

The main file for your solution to the assignment should be
`main.cc`.

You might need to modify `Makefile` if you are adding additional
source files for your code.

Commit your changes and submit on GitLab.

### Code evaluation

Run

```shell
bash ./eval.sh
```

This will automatically compile your code and test your code with sample cases. If there's no output, you've prefectly passed all the sample cases. Otherwise, the difference will be printed.

Your excutable file and output should be `pa1` and `/test/test_yours.out` respectively. You can also check your answer with standard output `/test/test.out` manually.

### Add your test cases

We only provide few test cases. So, it's important for you to add your own test cases and make your code robust enough.

Add your input and sample output in `test/test.in` and `test/test.out`. Each line is a test case.
